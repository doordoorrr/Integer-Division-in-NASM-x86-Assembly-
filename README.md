# Integer-Division-in-NASM-x86-Assembly-
A simple NASM x86 32-bit assembly program that prompts the user for two single-digit numbers, divides them using integer division, and prints both the quotient and remainder. The program handles input/output via Linux system calls and converts ASCII characters to integers for arithmetic operations.
